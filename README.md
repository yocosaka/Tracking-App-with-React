- Front-end to server user authentication implementation.
- Creating an admin panel enables item management operations like creation, updating, and deletion.
- Development of responsive layouts catering to both tablet and desktop interfaces, adhering to design standards.
- Incorporation of a progress page featuring dynamic data charts showcasing average achievement rates and total scores.

## How to use this app as a user

1. To start using this app as a user, you need to log in with a username and password. This login is authenticated by API
2. Then, you can record your track for each item for each day: Idioms, Pronunciation, Reading, etc.
3. On the all tracks page, you can check the past tracks you've made
4. On the progress page, you can see your progress so far

## How to manage items as an admin user

1. Like the ordinary user, you need to log in with a username and password as an admin user, which is required to be given the status of admin: true by the administrator for the API
  * You can see how to create admin user in the [Readme file for the REST API](https://github.com/yocosaka/Tracking-App-Api-with-Rails)
2. Then, you'll see the admin page. On this page, the items that are added by administrators will show
3. By clicking the "Add item" button, it shows the form, and you can add an item
4. By clicking each item, you can edit it
